# Day 2

## Goals
* Start with the solo project

## Thoughts on Week 10 / Day 2
* Finished the first project
* Reviewed Richard's code and he reviewed mine. It was so nice to see a different approach and to hear comments that would make me improve mine!
* Submitted it and started the other one
* Gilded rose was a little bit more confusing to understand but got there and finished it as well
