# Day 3

## Goals
* Attended Workshop for Database Domain Model Diagramming
* Afternoon challenge - pairing

## Thoughts on Week 4/ Day 3
* Informative workshop. I feel like I do not fully understand how to set up my own CRC cards.
* I worked amazingly with my pair partner. It was great to get to know another person and how they work.
* We only did one step but it took awhile and I think we learnt a lot.
