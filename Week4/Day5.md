# Day 5

## Goals
* Attend Retro
* Started Chitter
* Afternoon challenge - pairing

## Thoughts on Week 4/ Day 5
* Retro was informative today. It's nice to hear everyone is on the same boat.
* Still haven't solved the issue we had with Sean yesterday.
* Pairing was great. Didn't do any driving but I was so impressed with my pair partner and how he managed to connect everything with no much help from me.
* Started my chitter challenge. Just setting it up.
