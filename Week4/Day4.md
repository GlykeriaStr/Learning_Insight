# Day 4

## Goals
* Attended Workshop for Database Domain Model Diagramming
* Afternoon challenge - pairing

## Thoughts on Week 4/ Day 4
* Today I didn't do a lot of self learning.
* I worked on SQLzoo and learned some of the sql commands
* I kept going with the battle challenge, I have 2 steps to go. I was told that the last step is teaching us how to get rid of the global variables.
* The pairing went really well. We managed to do a whole step without looking at the walkthrough.
* I liked the way he organised his afternoon challeges. He has one file that it was his and then the days that he was working with others. I think that would be a great idea if you want to go back and redo it on the same day, to solidify what you have done.
* He also showed me that if you put --format documentation on the rspec file, when you run rspec, there is a detailed list where the error is.
* I think I have a much better understanding of how web apps are created and how they interact with the database but still a bit unsure how they get connected with ruby.
