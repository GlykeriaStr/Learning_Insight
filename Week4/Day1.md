# Day 1

## Goals
* Attend kick-off
* Attend workshop for mocks, stubs and doubles
* Afternoon challenge - pairing

## Thoughts on Week 4 / Day 1
* The weekend challenge went really well and I feel like I'm starting this week with a clearer understanding of building small web apps
* I need to work on CSS and refactor my rps code
* The mocks workshop was good. I think I understand mocks now, how they work and where I'm supposed to use them
* Pairing today was great! It's always a bit confusing on the Monday because everything is new but I feel like I learned a lot from my pairing partner.
