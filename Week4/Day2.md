# Day 2

## Goals
* Refactor my RPS code
* Have a look on what me and Miranda did yesterday and finish the step
* Afternoon challenge - pairing

## Thoughts on Week 4 / Day 2
* Refactoring the weekend challenge was good. I learned a lot about CSS and the premises of how it works
* I revisited yesteday's pairing and finished the table. I had to follow the walkthrough as everything is so new but I have a basic understanding of what we are doing.
* Pairing went really well. A lot to digest but most of it makes sense to me.
* Downloaded and played around with TablePlus
