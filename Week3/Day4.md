# Day 4

## Goals
* Debugging web / attend workshop
* Afternoon challenge / pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 3 / Day 4
* The debugging workshop was very helpful and it made me understand more about how the creating process works and how everything is connected.
* I feel much more confident in my process of debugging even though I know I need to work on not jumping the gun and actually going through the steps more thoroughly
* My pairing today was really good. Learned a lot about the different files and feature tests
