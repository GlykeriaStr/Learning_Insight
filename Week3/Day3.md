* Afternoon challenge - Pair programming
* Process Workshop

## Thoughts on Week 3 / Day 3
* After last night's pairing I felt quite lost so today I read a lot on rack that made things cleared to what everything is.
* I'm still trying to understand how everything is connected to each other and why do we need capybara when we have rspec.
* Today's pairing went really well. I felt a lot more confident with the code and what everything meant. Still had to look through a lot of the walkthroughs
* The process workshop went really well. I paired with someone from week 7 and she was extremely helpful with her notes :
    * I need to plan more before I start writing tests and coding
    * I need to refactor / split responsibility in my methods
    * Name my methods better
    * If you think that your test won't pass and it passes, double check why it passed
    * Write your test as much in English as possible, don't write array, write list
