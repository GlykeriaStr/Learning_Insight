# Day 1

## Goals
  * The goals for today is to try and be less hard on myself


## Thoughts on Week 3 / Day 1
  * Had a very difficult weekend with the takeaway challenge. Tried to do it on Saturday but maybe due to fatigue I couldn't think at all and found a video online that showed how to do it. I watched it and then tried to do the challenge myself. Halfway I started feeling like a complete fraud, that wasn't my code, even though I Understood what I was writing, I hadn't put the thought in it. So I left the challenge and focused on finishing Boris Bikes, which I did.
  * I want to refactor my airport code and ask a coach to review it.
  * Hopefully at some point I will come back to the takeaway challenge when I have some time.
  * Today we had our first meeting with Eoin, as we are starting this week to learn how to build a web app.
  * The pairing today was a bit different than other times because it was more learning a new language than TDDing.
  * I hope that by the end of this week I feel better about what I know and less impostor-like.
  * "The responsibility of my class is ___ and __". When you get the "and" it's a good time to rethink your class and if it needs splitting.
