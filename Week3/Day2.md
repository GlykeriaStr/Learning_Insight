# Day 2

## Goals
  * Do some research on how the web works and Sinatra
  * Afternoon challenge - pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 3 / Day 2
  * I started the day by watching a video of how the web works ( request / response ). It helped me understand a little bit better and definitely helped me in the workshop.
  * The workshop was about request/response. We opened the dev tools in our browser and created a diagram of what is happening in the background when you open a web page.(diagram and notes on Bear)
  * The afternoon challenge was a real challenge. There were so many new things that we were expected to know and do. I am getting more and more confused everyday.
  * Tomorrow I would like to look into all those questions that were risen from the challenge and maybe speak to a coach. (rack/ config.ru/ sinatra/ capybara/ scenario/ feature/ calling the file from spec_helper/ setting env constants)
  * I started a codeacademy course on HTML, so I can get a rough idea of how it works. At least that seems easy enough.
