# Day 4

## Goals
* Research localStorage - only a little bit
* Research API - fetch
* Have a look at the code and try to understand
* Group project - Note taking app Belarus

## Thoughts on Week 7 / Day 4
* Had a look at the code today. I understand what it says and what we are doing but I would never get there myself
* I need to work on it on my own from the beginning and go step by step
* I got feedback for my weekend challenge and my process workshop and I want to implement the changes on the Bowling JS
* Did another review example on my own. They are pretty straight forward but with the nerves I don't know what's going to happen.
* Very difficult week so far and very disheartening.
