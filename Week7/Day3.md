# Day 3

## Goals
* Attend workshop
* Group project - Note taking app Belarus

## Thoughts on Week 7 / Day 3
* There was a live coding workshop to show us how to start with our projects. It was a lot easier than what we have done. I'm still struggling to keep up with everything.
* In JS you can't compare two arrays like in Ruby. JS compares them as two separate objects and not the elements that are inside.
* Process workshop went well but I'm still finding difficult not to write complicated tests
