# Day 2

## Goals
* Research closures on JS
* Research event loops on JS
* Group project - Note taking app Belarus

## Thoughts on Week 7 / Day 2
* Looking into closures and trying to understand them took the whole morning.
* I think I have a better idea of what they are now, nested fuctions inside functions that have access to their parents variables (i think)
* The video I watched on the event loop was helpful to understand how js works. Still don't think I would be able to explain it efficiently
* With the group project we are moving fast but just realised we might have missed a couple of steps so we went back and downloaded node
* I watched another review to prepare for Friday and solved one in my own time using ruby
