# Day 1

## Goals
* Review the code
* Attend kick off
* Start with group project

## Thoughts on Week 7 / Day 1
* The code review went well. I added one more thing to my code when there is a double strike.
* $0 : reference to the element that is selected (console)
* This week I'm a bit worried. I don't feel very confident with Javascript and definitely not confident with interface.
* I would like to look into interface a bit more
* The afternoon went well. Writing our own tests wasn't as hard as I expected
* We are having some difficulties with getting the interface to work
* I'm very happy with my team. They all seem like they know what's going on and I might learn a lot from them and the way they work.
* I should start writing down tasks for after I finish Makers(projects, ideas, things I want to revisit).
