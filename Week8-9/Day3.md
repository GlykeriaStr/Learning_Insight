# Day 3

## Goals
* Group Project

## Thoughts on Week 8 / Day 3
* We had some break throughs this morning. The rails devise command and the work Richard did on Heroku helped move on with the Project
* Alice and Alex joined us and we had a chat. They were very positive.
* We have a better understanding of how the sprints need to be run and hopefully from tomorrow we will have roles and work in groups
