# Day 2

## Goals
* Group Project

## Thoughts on Week 8 / Day 2
* We did some work on the code but in general we are pretty stuck with rails
* We took an hour off in the evening to have a look and read as much as we can on rails
* I had a great catch up with Holly and she sent me an amazing link on devise that helped massively
* Still feeling pretty lost and confused. I don't know what I am supposed to be learning right now
