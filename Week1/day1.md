# Day 1

##Goals
No goals for today

## Thoughts on Day 1
 * Today was more of a talk about how the next 12 weeks will go.
 * What I need to remember is :
    * Try and have a Growth Mindset, it will help a lot in the course but also in life
    * This is a marathon, not a sprint. I should pace myself.
    * Check in with myself, feel how I feel, acknowledge it and not try to change it
    * It's better to overcommunicate than undercommunicate
    * Being self-lead doesn't mean I have to do everything on my own. Ask for help from cohort and coaches
    * Trust the process
    * Try and enjoy it
    * Focus on my learning and don't compare myself with others
    * They purposely gives us too many tasks. We are not supposed to finish everything. The goal is not completing the task but identifying what we are learning from it and from each other.
    * Try and remember that I belong here!
