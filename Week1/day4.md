# Day 4

## Goals
* Do an easier TDD
* Focus on the workshop on TDD
* Pair programming

## Thoughts on Day 4
* The workshop helped me understand why we use TDD, why we write tests and why we write them first
* Today I had to redo some steps on boris bikes challenge which helped immensely with my understanding of some concepts
* I learned that if you write irb -r "filename" it requires the file as it opens irb
* Solidified my understanding of the difference between fork and clone
