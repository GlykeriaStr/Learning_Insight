# Week 1

## Goals
By the end of the week all developers can:

* Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
* Pair using the driver-navigator style
* Follow an effective debugging process
* Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Challenges
* afternoons - boris bike pair challenge
* end of unit - Airport challenge

## Practicals

These can be used by the devs independently, or enhanced by a coach delivering and offering structured process, group discussion, feedback, etc.
