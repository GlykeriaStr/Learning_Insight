## Thoughts on Day 2
  * Today we did our first workshop on debugging. I felt really confident after it. Learned about stack trace and how to follow an error message to get to the bug.
  * To check if an instance of a class is created (while debugging) put a puts on the initialize method
  * Remembered the main steps when starting a new project:
    * make a directory
    * git init in the directory
    * install rspec
    * init rspec
    * write a feature test and then a unit test
    * set up a unit test
    * write the code to pass the test

    * create a new repo
    * clone the repo onto the directory
    * git remote add origin "SSH"
    * git add / commit / push

  * Still don't understand the difference between SSH and HTTPS
  * I'm not sure about the difference between clone and fork
