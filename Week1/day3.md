# Day 3

## Goals
  * [] More TDD
  * [] Read about encapsulating
  * [] Pairing programming

## Thoughts on day 3
  * Even though I understand the importance of TDD, I'm struggling how to connect RSpec with the code
  * I've had a difficult time with the TDD exercise I tried but I'll keep trying
  * I need to remember to set small objectives that are easy check if I accomplished them
  * Be more patient during pairing
  * I read about encapsulating and understood it
  * Overall, a difficult day but I am sure I learned somethings already
