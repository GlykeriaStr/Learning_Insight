# Day 2

## Goals
* Start creating the Model on MakersBnB

## Thoughts on Week 5 / Day 2
* We started today with a standup that went really well and we had a clear idea of what we are going to do
* Meg and I did a lot of the model already and it seems like it's working nicely
* Reeshul and Jonathan did an amazing job on the controller and the css.
* Learned how to create a branch and push to the main and create a pull request. (info is on bear)
* Miranda posted a very informative blog on ActiveRecord and I will try to understand it and implement it on my chitter repo
