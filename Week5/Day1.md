## Thoughts on Week 5 / Day 1
* The code review went so well. My partner gave me some excellent feedback on how to improve my code.
* I managed to implement some of them in my spare time.
* The chitter didn't pass the pull request test. I would like to go back to it and fix it.
* Alice zoomed with my to help me with my code on bookmarks that didn't work(it was working on the web but wouldn't pass one feature test/ it was not going to the correct route).
* She showed me that if you put save_and_open_page in your feature test it will open the page you are testing
* The problem was that I needed to enable methodoverwrite on the controller and not on the config file
* With the team we did some sequence diagrams for how our app will work.
