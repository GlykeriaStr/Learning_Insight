# Day 4

## Goals
  * Revisit doubles and classes
  * Pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 2 / Day 4
  * I did a secret diary practical.
  * Talked to my mentor and it was really nice to hear that she was having the same struggles as me on her second week. She also helped me with the secret diary challenge.
  * Today pair programming went really well. We managed to do almost all step 14( dividing Oystercard class into 2 classes, Oystercard and Journey ). The most important thing is that I feel like I understood everything we've done and why we've done it. This alone feels like an accomplishment.
  * Still not 100% on doubles
  * Dividing classes is really hard and I need to exercise more. Maybe do some exercises like the one with terrible and great!
