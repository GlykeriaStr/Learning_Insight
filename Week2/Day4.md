# Day 4

## Goals
* Revisit doubles and classes
* Pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 2 / Day 4
 * Today pair programming went really well. We managed to do almost all step 14( dividing Oystercard class into 2 classes, Oystercard and Journey ). The most important thing is that I feel like I understood everything we've done and why we've done it. This alone feels like an accomplishment.
 * Still not 100% on doubles
 * Dividing classes is really hard and I need to exercise more. Maybe do some exercises like the one with terrible and great!
