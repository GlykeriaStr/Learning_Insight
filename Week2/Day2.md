# Day 2

## Goals
  * Try and research doubles
  * Do more Boris Bikes
  * Pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 2 / Day 2
  * Today we did a workshop on domain and domain modelling. It was really helpful to see how much simpler it makes everything after you have broken the user stories down and had a clear idea how objects and methods will interact with each other.
  * The pair session went really well. My partner and I were both pretty clueless about doubles but I think after today I know at least how to create them. Still not sure why we need them.
  * I looked up bloom's taxonomy.
  * Need to have a look on i-term and my zsh
