# WEEK 2

## Goals

* By the end of the week I should be able to:

  * Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
  * Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
  * Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
  * Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
  * Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Challenges

* [Afternoons - Oystercard](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard)
