# Day 1

## Goals
  * Oystercard challenge

## Thoughts on Week 2, Day 1
  * Today we did our first code review and learned why it's important to review each other's code
    * It helps us learn from each other by seeing other ways to solve a problem, learning new techniques
    * Getting used to getting and giving feedback to peers
    * Helps you understand your code better when you are forced to explain why you did what you did
    * Getting used to reading and understanding other people's code

  * I had some comments on my code that helped refactor the rspec to be neater as well as some changes that I have yet to do on my plane.rb file
  * The afternoon challenge went really well and I worked very well with my partner
  * Understood what stubs are how to use them
  * Still not know how to use double
  * Need to research Bloom Taxonomy
  * I have a better understanding of SRP
