# Day 3

## Goals
  * Do more research on doubles
  * Maybe keep going with Boris Bikes
  * Pair programming
  * Process workshop

## Thoughts on Week 2 / Day 3
  * The EQ workshop was helpful to have a better understanding how to give and receive feedback
  * I had another look on documentation on doubles and the word let
  * During the pairing session we had to go back a few steps but I am very glad we did! Having to do it again helped me understand much better why we had to use a double and how it's used.
  * Holly has also informed me about an app to keep notes, called Bear, which seems really helpful
  * Did my first process workshop. I'm looking forward to the next one.
  * Starting to feel much more confident in my knowledge and ability to TDD, debug and write tests.
