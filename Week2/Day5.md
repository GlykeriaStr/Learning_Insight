# Day 5

## Goals
  * Work on devising classes
  * Pair programming

## Thoughts on Week 2 / Day 5
  * I finished the secret diary practical I started yesterday because I thought we needed to pass irb as well as rspec but it was only rspec.
  * After speaking to my peer group I refactor my code for the Oystercard challenge and continued a little bit into step 15, creating JourneyLog.
  * In the pair programming I had to go back and redo some of step 14 but going back helped me solidify my understanding of the code.
  * Definitely have a better understanding of doubles than I did at the beginning of the week and I can Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.
