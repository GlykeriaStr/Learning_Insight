# Day 4

## Goals
* Attend the workshop
* Speak to possible mentees
* Thermostat - Pairing

## Thoughts on Week 6 / Day 4
* The workshop was a bit confusing for me. I understood that before any function the pages loads. But I am still very unsure about callbacks
* I spoke to 3 people about being their mentor. 2 of them have signed in already! It's so nice to be able to help someone that is going through the same as I did a few weeks ago.
* I need to watch the video about the js loop event
* Many questions about jQuery, how it works, what it is. It feels very much like how I felt with rack and sinatra.
* The pairing went well. It was very front-end and I feel very lost when it comes to css and how to implement it.
* After finishing pairing I went to my own repo and redid everything to understand them a little better
* Tomorrow I want to read more on jQuery
