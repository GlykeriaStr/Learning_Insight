# Day 5

## Goals
* Attend the retro

## Thoughts on Week 6 / Day 5
* The pairing went well. I didn't do any driving because we had to go back a few steps and I wanted to give my partner the opportunity to do them
* It was very helpful for me to go through it again though
* We talked a lot about reviews and I booked mine for next Friday at 4pm
