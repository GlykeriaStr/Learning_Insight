# Day 2

## Goals
* TDD in Javascript workshop
* Thermostat - Pairing

## Thoughts on Week 6 / Day 2
* TDD a few easy codewars on Javascript which helped me understand much better how it works
* Pairing was great but we had to use a lot of the walkthrough when we came to the airport challenge.
* I learned a lot about stubs and mocks in Javascript
* In TDD we used reduce method and I want to have a look at it because I didn't really understand what it does
* Talked about the differences between var, let, const
