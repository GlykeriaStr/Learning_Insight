# Day 3

## Goals
* Keep working on the airport challenge
* Thermostat - Pairing

## Thoughts on Week 6 / Day 3
* Working on the airport challenge helped. I couldn't figure out some errors but we had a zoom for a couple more people in the cohort to solve someone else's code and I learned a lot.
* console.log() is like writing p in ruby and rspec
* Writing code in the console is like using irb
* In the pairing I felt a lot more comfortable with the syntax of Javascript
