# Day 1

## Goals
* Code review
* Kick-off
* Thermostat - Pairing

## Thoughts on Week 6 / Day 1
* Review was great. Very good feedback. I need to refactor my code (maybe start over) to have two classes and fix edge cases
* Started with Javascript
* Pairing went very well. Everything we have done so far I understood and hopefully remember
